Be your own light. Then be bright. Shine for others to see. This can be done from the deepest depths of the the earth, isolated from any living thing and have tremendous weight. 

Emit your own tone. Then be loud.
Be heard without anyone near through the thickest of walls. Allow your positive vibration out.

Carve your own slab. Cast a resonant mold. Let it be filled by nature and grow for evermore...
