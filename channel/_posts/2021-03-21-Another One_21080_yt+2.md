- *Be your own light*. Then be bright. Shine for others to see. This can be done from the deepest depths of the earth, isolated from any living thing and have tremendous weight.
 
- Emit your own tone. Then be loud.
Be heard without anyone near through the thickest of walls. Allow your positive vibration out.

- Carve your own slab. Cast a resonant mold. Let it be filled by nature and grow for evermore...

-Umbra
