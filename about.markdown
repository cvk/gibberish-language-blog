</h1>[jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Complex Sentence Generator is very easy to use. After typing or pasting content in the first text box, press the convert button to automatically paraphrase the content. This generator can also work as a random sentence generator. Click on the random sentence button to generate random complex sentences and have them paraphrased. This software works as a paraphrase converter for transforming simple and common english into more complex english. It can be useful as a free article spinner due to its' ability to rephrase a large body of text and potentially generate multiple unique versions with each conversion of the same content. With complex sentence generator you can reword content online and rewrite up to 10000 characters or less at a time/per conversion. This should be more than enough for spinning articles, essays or paraphrasing website content for blogs which usually consists of a large amount of content.

In order to rephrase a sentence, paragraph, essay or article effectively, content with good grammar and spelling is important when using this automatic paraphraser because it can only recognize, understand and rewrite correct grammar. For an article rewriter that is in the form of a bot, it does a good job of respecting english and using replacements that make sense. Content that is written in all caps or with the first letter of every word capitalized can still be rephrased by this software. Otherwise, as long as the grammar of the content is sensible and recognizable, complex sentence generator can make the task of paraphrasing easy. Rather than having to research synonyms for words or phrases and deduce which ones are the most suitable substitutes for any context a word or phrase may be used in, paraphrasing is done on auto pilot.

Aside from simply being used as a tool to spin text or paraphrase content, complex sentence generator can be instrumental towards accomplishing a number of additional tasks. Improving vocabulary, learning new ways to utilize english words and phrases and adding more uniqueness to the process of generating new content. You can also use paraphrase search to learn new words by searching for examples of words/phrases being used in a sentence and paraphrased in a sentence. Due to how rare and uncommon a lot of the words and phrases are in the database of this paraphrase generator, it can create and exhibit a unique style of writing and vocabulary. It also makes it easier to encounter and discover new words.

It might sound silly at first, but you don’t actually own your blog. It’s hosted on someone else’s web property and they can delete it if they want to. They have done so in the past, and keep doing it in the future. Which means all your hard work on your blog, all those countless hours of writing blog posts might have vanished within seconds. Sad…

On the other hand, with a self-hosted blog on your own domain name – you are the REAL owner of your blog. You’ll be able to name your blog whatever you want, for example, “YourName.com” or “YourAwesomeBlog.com. You can end it with .com, .co.uk, .net, .org, or virtually any other web suffix. Add to that unlimited bandwidth for videos, images, and content plus the free themes and you have a winning combo.

So how much is hosting and a domain name? Not as much as you’re thinking, fortunately. It usually works out to about $5 to $10 per month, depending on your hosting provider which is less than a couple of coffees.

If you still have questions, here’s some further information for you to look at:

It’s probably one of the cheapest (less than $3 per month) hosting providers out there. A domain name will cost around $10-15 a year, but with Hostgator, you can get that for FREE first year.

If you do sign up with Hostgator be sure to use the coupon code BB101 as this will unlock the maximum discount they offer on all their hosting packages.

:). Big smiles for that!

They’re the providers I use for all of my blogs, including the one you’re reading right now.

If for any reason you don’t want to go with Hostgator, feel free to choose your own hosting company. Most, if not all of them, should have a “one-click” WordPress install solution on their admin panel.

That button will automatically install WordPress on your blog. Did I say it was simple or what?

All you need to do is sign up with Hostgator (or your chosen provider), choose your hosting plan and a domain name and look for the one-click WordPress install button on the admin panel.

If you are getting stuck at any point this guide may help as it has screenshots.

WordPress essentials aren’t often needed, but I’d recommend whois privacy (that will keep all your personal details private) and definitely automated backups (that’ll save your website just in case anything fails or disappears so you won’t lose any or very little of your blog).


Remember, your blog’s design should reflect both you and your personality, but also what the blog is about. There’s no point having a football-orientated theme if your blog is about tennis, understand?

On top of that, it should be easy to navigate if you want people to stick around. If it’s tricky and difficult to move around it, people won’t stay. After all design is a subjective art; meaning everyone likes different things.

But no one likes ugly websites, and they especially hate websites that need a university degree to navigate. Make it easy for them.
