Dedicated to the Spirit of Collecting and Digital Art Curation, sixteen silly, on-chain, non-generative, animated sprites were hand-crafted to bring joy directly to the clean Tezos Blockchain. These Houses hold Cabinets of Curiosities. The preview (first) frame is Standard NFT License while the other 3 frames are licensed cc0. All without support. 16 Editions of 16 Houses, sized 16px Square. Inspiration: Suzanna "Gol"d, Hans Ulrich O"bris"t, & Harald "Szee"mann, curators. What art-style or movement will your House declare? Quid stylus aut motus eliges in discordia?
<br><br>

Q1: What are they? ... blobs, heads, monsters, skulls, ghosts, aliens? 

>They're intentionally ambiguous.

Q2: Any more coming? What are the plans for these?

>The House of Golbriszees opened to celebrate friendships and connections made collecting, sharing, displaying, and admiring digital art. It is my hope they will be sought by collector/curators as it was created to celebrate them. 

Q3: Why not 1/1's?

>Curation is a shared endevour, not an exclusive one. 

Q4: How are the Houses different?

>I would say my vision might resemble something like 'one House for generative', 'one House for photography', 'one House for glitch', etc., etc., It is completely up to the Houses to self declare.
