Dedicated to the spirit of digital art collection & curation, sixteen on-chain, non-generative, animated sprites were sprung from the studio to chaperone joy to experiencing the Blockchainerary Art Movement. Ironically poor color palettes byte into four sequenced frames of two hundred fifty-six pixels.  
<br>
Q1: What are they? ... blobs, heads, monsters, skulls, ghosts, aliens? 

>They're intentionally ambiguous.

Q2: Any more coming? What are the plans for these?

>The House of Golbriszees ~~opened~~ to celebrate friendships and connections made collecting, sharing, displaying, and admiring digital art. It is my hope they will be sought by collector/curators as it was created to celebrate them. 

Q3: Why not 1/1's?

>Curation is a shared endevour, not an exclusive one. 

Q4: How are the Houses different?

>I would say my vision might resemble something like 'one House for generative', 'one House for photography', 'one House for glitch', etc., etc., It is completely up to the Houses to self declare.
